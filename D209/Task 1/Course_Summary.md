# D209: Data Mining I -- Task 1: Classification Analysis
## Course Overview
Data Mining I expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data mining models—to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course provides frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity. D208 Predictive Modeling is a prerequisite to this course.

## Course Objectives
* The graduate applies observations to appropriate classes and categories using classification models.
* The graduate implements prediction data mining models to find hard-to-spot relationships among variables.
* The graduate evaluates data mining model performance for precision, accuracy, and model comparison.

## Performace Assessment Introduction
In this task, you will act as an analyst and create a data mining report. In doing so, you must select one of the data dictionary and data set files to use for your report from the following link: Data Sets and Associated Data Dictionaries.

You should also refer to the data dictionary file for your chosen data set from the provided link. You will use Python or R to analyze the given data and create a data mining report in a word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word). Throughout the submission, you must visually represent each step of your work and the findings of your data analysis.

Note: All algorithms and visual representations used need to be captured either in tables or as screenshots added into the submitted document. A separate Microsoft Excel (.xls or .xlsx) document of the cleaned data should be submitted along with the written aspects of the data mining report.

## Performance Assessment Requirements
Part I: Research Question<br>
A.  Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:
1.  Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer using one of the following classification methods:
* k-nearest neighbor (KNN)
* Naive Bayes
2.  Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the scenario and is represented in the available data.

Part II: Method Justification<br>
B.  Explain the reasons for your chosen classification method from part A1 by doing the following:
1.  Explain how the classification method you chose analyzes the selected data set. Include expected outcomes.
2.  Summarize one assumption of the chosen classification method.
3.  List the packages or libraries you have chosen for Python or R and justify how each item on the list supports the analysis.

Part III: Data Preparation<br>
C.  Perform data preparation for the chosen data set by doing the following:
1.  Describe one data preprocessing goal relevant to the classification method from part A1.
2.  Identify the initial data set variables that you will use to perform the analysis for the classification question from part A1 and classify each variable as numeric or categorical.
3.  Explain each of the steps used to prepare the data for the analysis. Identify the code segment for each step.
4.  Provide a copy of the cleaned data set.

Part IV: Analysis<br>
D.  Perform the data analysis and report on the results by doing the following:
1.  Split the data into training and test data sets and provide the file(s).
2.  Describe the analysis technique you used to appropriately analyze the data. Include screenshots of the intermediate calculations you performed.
3.  Provide the code used to perform the classification analysis from part D2.

Part V: Data Summary and Implications<br>
E.  Summarize your data analysis by doing the following:
1.  Explain the accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) of your classification model.
2.  Discuss the results and implications of your classification analysis.
3.  Discuss one limitation of your data analysis.
4.  Recommend a course of action for the real-world organizational situation from part A1 based on your results and implications discussed in part E2.

Part VI: Demonstration<br>
F.  Provide a Panopto video recording that includes a demonstration of the functionality of the code used for the analysis and a summary of the programming environment.

G.  Acknowledge web sources, using in-text citations and references, for segments of third-party code or data used to support the analysis. Be sure the web sources are reliable.

H.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

I.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

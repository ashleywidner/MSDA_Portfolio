# D212: Data Mining II

## Course Summary
Data Mining II adds vital tools to the data analytics arsenal that incorporates unsupervised models. This course explains when, how, and why to use these tools to best meet organizational needs. 

This course has three practical assessments. 

## Course Objectives
This course covers the following competencies:
- **Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering Techniques:** The graduate applies clustering techniques to accurately predict outcomes of interest.
- **Principal Component Analysis:** The graduate implements dimension reduction methods to identify significant variables.
- **Market Basket Analysis:** The graduate predicts patterns in data using association rules and lift analysis.


### Task 1
This project requires the student to use one either k-means or hierarchical clustering on one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) to analyze the data. After selecting the variables of interest, the student generates a clustering model to facilitate this analysis. The student then communicates the results of their analysis and evaluates the model.  

The WGU Evaluation faculty has selected my recent submission for Task 1 in Data Mining II to be recognized with an Excellence Award due to the exceptional nature of the work I submitted. The award can be found under the WGU Academic Credentials tab.

The evaluator shared the following about my Task 1 submission:
“The submission on Clustering Techniques was excellent because you effectively discussed the results and implications of the k-means clustering analysis, the limitation of the data analysis, and the proposed course of action. Well done!”

### Task 2
This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question, using one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset (over 50 features). The student identifies the number of principal components and the variance of each component, before addressing the research question with those principal components. 


### Task 3
This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question regarding one of two new datasets, using market basket analysis and association rules to analyze customer behaviors.

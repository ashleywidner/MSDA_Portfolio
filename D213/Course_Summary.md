# D213: Advanced Data Analysis

## Course Summary
Advanced Data Analytics prepares students for career-long growth in steadily advancing tools and techniques and provides emerging concepts in data analysis. This course hones the mental and theoretical flexibility that will be required of analysts in the coming decades while grounding their approach firmly in ethical and organizational-need-focused practice. Topics include machine learning, neural networks, randomness, and unconventional data sources.

This course has two practical assessments. 

## Course Objectives
This course covers the following competencies:
- **Time Series Analysis:** The graduate applies time series models in generating forecasts.
- **Neural Networks:** The graduate builds neural networks in the context of machine-learning modeling.
- **Natural Language Processing:** The graduate extracts insights from text data using effective and appropriate natural processing (NLP) models.


### Task 1
This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question, using one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and ARIMA/SARIMA time series modelling techniques. The student must generate a number of time series visualizations, evaluate the stationarity of the series, account for trends and seasonality, and develop a forecast in the course of addressing this research question. 

### Task 2
This project requires the student to select one of a number of authorized datasets to develop a research question to be addressed through sentiment analysis, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning within a neural network. The student must perform an exploratory data analysis of their selected dataset, tokenize the data, and develop a model using TensorFlow, including justification of both hyperparameters of that model and the neural network layers involved. Finally, the effectiveness of the generated model must be evaluated.

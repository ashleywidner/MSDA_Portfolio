# D205: Data Acquisition

## Course Summary
Data Acquisition builds proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) and the initial stages of the data analytics lifecycle. The course introduces relational databases. Students gain concrete skills in data transference and database manipulation. There are no prerequisites.

## Course Objectives
This course covers the following competencies: 
* The graduate examines the data available for analysis to determine their dimension, quality, relations, and limitations. 
* The graduate implements physical data models. 
* The graduate performs table operations and queries within the context of data acquisition for analysis.

## Performance Assessment Requirements
Perform the following tasks to combine an existing data set with some external data:

A.  Provide a question that can be answered using structured query language (SQL) to acquire data from both the original database and the add-on CSV file data. The question should require data from both data sources.
1.  Identify which data from the original data set and the add-on CSV file are needed to answer the question including all tables, columns, and data types.

B.  Create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for the add-on CSV file and any other tables and columns used to answer the question from part A by evaluating the data contained in the file and identifying the m:n relationships and relational constraints.
1.  Write SQL code, in text format, that creates a table based on the ERD and specifies the columns and relevant keys.
2.  Write SQL code, in text format, that loads the data from one of the add-on CSV files into the table created in part B1.
 
C.  Write a SQL statement or statements in text format for a query or queries that answer the question from part A.
1.  Provide a data file or files that capture the results from the query or queries.

D.  Identify the specific time period for how often the add-on file should be acquired and refreshed in the database for the data to remain relevant to the business and the question from part A.
1.  Explain why the time period identified in part D is relevant to the business needs.

E.  Provide a Panopto video recording that includes the presenter and a vocalized demonstration showing all code used, the code being executed, and the results of all code used in the task.
1.  Include a vocalized demonstration within the Panopto video recording provided in part E that describes the programs used to complete the task.

F.  Acknowledge web sources used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the application. Be sure the web sources are reliable.

G.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

H.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

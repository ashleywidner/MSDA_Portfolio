# D211: Advanced Data Acquisition

## Course Summary
Advanced Data Acquisition enhances theoretical and SQL skills in furthering the data analytics life cycle. This course covers advanced SQL operations, aggregating data, and acquiring data from various sources in support of core organizational needs. The prerequisite for this course is Representation and Reporting.

## Course Objectives
This course covers the following competencies:
* Explore Data - The graduate explores data acquisition.
* Advanced SQL Operations - The graduate applies advanced SQL operations to integrate multiple data sources.

## Introduction
The data analyst’s job does not end once the data has been analyzed. A vital skill for data analysts is to represent and report the data to stakeholders. In this task, you will demonstrate your ability to identify actionable insights from data and communicate them using effective storytelling methods.

This task consists of three parts:
* In part 1, you will use SQL and a business intelligence tool to create data dashboards to support executive decision-making. Your dashboards should enable leaders to answer a specific research question on an organizational need. It is recommended, but not required, that the business intelligence tool be Tableau.

Your dashboard will integrate data from two sources:
1. Provided dataset: You will select one of the datasets, either churn or medical_data, which are already loaded into PostgreSQL and accessible with pgAdmin4 or Tableau in the Labs on Demand (LOD). The Web Links section at the bottom of the task page has the link for accessing LOD.
2. Additional dataset: You will identify an external public dataset as an additional dataset for your dashboard. This dataset should contain data and variables that complement the dataset you chose from the provided options and should enhance the insights you can gain from the provided dataset. Recommended sources include U.S. census data, Kaggle, or other public data repositories. You are responsible for ensuring that you have the rights to use the dataset.

* In part 2, you will give a simulated presentation to a panel of peers. You will describe the use of SQL in preparing the data from the two datasets for the analysis and then demonstrate the functionality of the SQL scripts and other codes that supported the creation of the dashboards.
* In part 3, you will write a reflection paper to outline the organizational need and summarize the findings from the analysis.

## Performance Assessment Requirements
Part I:  Data Dashboard<br>
A.  Provide a copy of your dashboard that supports executive decision-making.
1.  Provide both data sets that serve as the data source for the dashboard.
2.  Provide step-by-step instructions on how to have the dashboard appear fully operational on a default version in Labs on Demand.
3. Provide step-by-step instructions to help users navigate the dashboard.
4.  Provide all SQL code or other code supporting the dashboard in text format.

Part II: Demonstration<br>
B.  Provide a link to a Panopto multimedia presentation in which you tell a story about the data to an audience of data analytics peers. You should do all of the following in your presentation:
1.  Describe the technical environment used to create the dashboard.
2.  Demonstrate the functionality of the dashboard.
3.  Explain the SQL scripts used to support the creation of the dashboard.
4.  Explain how the data streams were prepared to support the analysis.
5.  Describe how data were aligned with other data points.
6.  Demonstrate how the database was created.
7.  Explain how referential integrity was enforced in the database.

Part III: Report<br>
C.  Write a report to outline the exploration of the data, the use of advanced SQL operations, and the analysis of the data. Do the following as part of your report:
1.  Explain how the purpose and function of your dashboard aligns with the needs of the stakeholders for your chosen dataset.
2.  Justify the selection of the business intelligence tool you used.
3.  Explain the steps used to clean and prepare the data for the analysis.
4.  Summarize the steps used to create the dashboard.
5.  Discuss the results of your data analysis and how it supported the purpose and function of your dashboard.
6.  Discuss the limitation(s) of your data analysis. 

D.  List the web source(s) used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the application. Ensure the web sources are reliable.

E.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

F.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

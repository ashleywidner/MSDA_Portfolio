# D207: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Course Summary
Exploratory Data Analysis covers statistical principles supporting the data analytics life cycle. Students in this course compute and interpret measures of central tendency, correlations, and variation. The course introduces hypothesis testing, focusing on application for parametric tests, and addresses communication skills and tools to explain an analystâ€™s findings to others within an organization. Data Cleaning is a required prerequisite for this course.

## Course Objectives
* The graduate interprets central tendency, correlations, and variation to inform organizational decisions.
* The graduate conducts parametric hypothesis testing.

## Course Introduction
An organization has collected raw data to analyze its operations and support its decision-making processes. The raw data files from the Data Cleaning course have been cleaned and prepared for exploratory analysis.

To compete this assessment, you will access a data dictionary file and its corresponding data flat file. You will analyze the data set using specific techniques, create visualizations, and deliver the results of your analysis.

## Performance Assessment Requirements
A.  Describe a real-world organizational situation or issue in the Data Dictionary you chose, by doing the following:
1.  Provide one question that is relevant to your chosen data set. You will answer this question later in the task through an analysis of the cleaned data, using one of the following techniques: chi-square, t-test, or analysis of variance (ANOVA).
2.  Explain how stakeholders in the organization could benefit from an analysis of the data.
3.  Identify all of the data in your data set that are relevant to answering your question in part A1.

B.  Describe the data analysis by doing the following:
1.  Using one of the following techniques, write code (in either Python or R) to run the analysis of the data set:
* chi-square
* t-test
* ANOVA
2.  Provide the output and the results of any calculations from the analysis you performed.
3.  Justify why you chose this analysis technique.

C.  Identify the distribution of two continuous variables and two categorical variables using univariate statistics from your cleaned and prepared data.
1. Represent your findings in Part C, visually as part of your submission.<br>
Note: To draw a graph or visualization, you may use one or a combination of the following:
* A spreadsheet program, such as Excel (*.xls)
* A graphics program, such as Paint (*.jpeg, *.gif)
* A word-processing program, such as Word (*.rtf)
* A scanned hand-drawn graph (*.jpeg, *.gif)

D.  Identify the distribution of two continuous variables and two categorical variables using bivariate statistics from your cleaned and prepared data.
1. Represent your findings in Part D, visually as part of your submission.<br>
Note: To draw a graph or visualization, you may use one or a combination of the following:
* A spreadsheet program, such as Excel (*.xls)
* A graphics program, such as Paint (*.jpeg, *.gif)
* A word-processing program, such as Word (*.rtf)
* A scanned hand-drawn graph (*.jpeg, *.gif)

E.  Summarize the implications of your data analysis by doing the following:
1.  Discuss the results of the hypothesis test.
2.  Discuss the limitations of your data analysis.
3.  Recommend a course of action based on your results.

F.  Provide a Panopto video recording that includes a demonstration of the functionality of the code used for the analysis and a summary of the tool(s) used.

G.  Reference the web sources used to acquire segments of third-party code to support the analysis. 

H.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

I.   Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

# D214: Data Analytics Graduate Capstone

## Course Summary
The Data Analytics Graduate Capstone allows students to apply the academic and professional abilities developed as a graduate student. This capstone challenges students to integrate skills and knowledge from several program domains into one project.

This course consists of three tasks. 

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this course:
- **Professional Readiness:** The graduate integrates and synthesizes competencies from across the degree program, thereby demonstrating the ability to participate in and contribute value to the chosen professional field.

### Task 1
This task requires students to develop a proposal for the topic of their capstone project, beginning with defining the intended research question as well as the null and alternative hypotheses for the study. Students must explain the context of the intended research and justify the processes, techniques, and tools to be used in the course of gathering, preparing, and analyzing the data. The capstone project is required to be "business-oriented" as a means to demonstrate preparation for entering the professional realm from the academic. A number of topics are also listed as being "retired" by WGU because they have been previously covered, meaning that these topics may not be selected for capstone research. 

### Task 2
This task requires the student to perform their capstone research topic and create a report outlining the various steps of this process. This includes the research question, the data collection & preparation processes, the analysis addressing the research question, and a summary of the outcome of the analysis, including limitations, recommendations, and additional opportunities for supplemental research. 

### Task 3
This task requires the student to develop an executive summary of their capstone project from Task 2. This executive summary is intended for an audience with expertise in data analysis, and it must communicate the study problem & hypothesis, the data analysis process, study findings, study limitations, recommended actions (including avenues for further study), and expected corporate benefits.
